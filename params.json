If a fastq sequence is invalid, this sequence is skipped.\r\nAny part of the sequence name following a blank space will be removed\r\n\r\n## FastqSeq : Simple object representing a Fastq sequence\r\nFastqSeq is a simple python object class generating a object representing a Fastq sequence. The object is initialized with:\r\n\r\n* A name for the sequence without @\r\n* A DNA sequence as a string\r\n* A quality score, as an **illumina 1.8+** encoded quality string, a numpy.ndarray of integers in **Phred +33** or python list of integers in **Phred +33**\r\n* Eventually a short text description\r\n\r\nThe DNA sequence and the quality score must have the same size otherwise an assertion error is raised\r\n\r\nAfter creation the object has the following fields:\r\n\r\n* name = name of the sequence without @.\r\n* seq = The DNA sequence of the fastq sequence store as a simple string.\r\n* qual = An numpy integer ndarray representing the Phred Quality of bases (support all np.array methods)\r\n* descr = A description of the fastq sequence.\r\n* qualstr = A string of letters corresponding to the sequence quality in illumina 1.8+ Phred 33 encoding\r\n* fastqstr = The field \"descr\" will be included in the output fastq sequence name after a space if present\r\n\r\nThe object support slicing([0:10]), concatenation(seq1+seq2) and the len method\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contact\r\n\r\nAdrien Leger - 2015\r\n\r\n* <adrien.leger@gmail.com> - <adrien.leger@inserm.fr> - <adrien.leger@univ-nantes.fr>\r\n* [Github](https://github.com/a-slide)\r\n* [Atlantic Gene Therapies - INSERM 1089](http://www.atlantic-gene-therapies.fr/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
